        <h1>Hi, I am Gabriel</h1>
        <p>As a product manager, I have a proven track record of kickstarting B2C and B2B projects that meet customer needs. I have conducted experiments to validate customer desirability and have held extensive customer and stakeholder interviews to inform product development decisions. My holistic approach considers the needs of the user, business, and society. I am eager to bring my experience to a mid-sized startup or large organisation and help them achieve their objectives.</p>
